# Don't work much with java projects. Don't like the thought that a gradle daemon runs forever whenever I compile a random java project.
# Especially makes fixing build issues a pain. If e.g. the first build failed due to java version mismatch just switching java version won't fix it.
# Would also need to remember restarting gradle daemon, which is not exactly likely.
org.gradle.daemon=false
